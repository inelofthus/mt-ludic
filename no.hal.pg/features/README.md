# The no.hal.pg.features folder

## Introduction

This folder contains the following *feature* projects:

- [no.hal.pg.feature](no.hal.pg.feature/) - The bundles supporting development of games, but not needed for the runtime.
- [no.hal.pg.runtime.feature](no.hal.pg.runtime.feature/) - Bundles that are needed in the runtime, i.e. running a game on some node in the cloud.
